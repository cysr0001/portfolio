## About My Portfolio

This portfolio is a showcase of my skills, projects, and design philosophy as a web developer and designer. It highlights my ability to create responsive, accessible, and visually appealing web experiences. The portfolio includes sections such as a hero banner, portfolio previews, testimonials, and a footer with essential links and contact information.

## Development Process

### 1. **Planning and Design**

- I started by outlining the structure of the portfolio, identifying key sections such as the hero banner, portfolio previews, testimonials, and footer.
- I created wireframes to visualize the layout and ensure a logical flow of content.
- Accessibility and responsiveness were prioritized from the beginning to ensure the portfolio would work well across devices and for all users.

### 2. **Development**

- I used HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS3 for styling, and Bootstrap for responsiveness and layout consistency.
- I implemented animations and hover effects to enhance interactivity and user engagement.
- I ensured proper use of ARIA roles, alt attributes, and schema.org markup to make the portfolio accessible and SEO-friendly.

### 3. **Testing and Iteration**

- I tested the portfolio on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
- I used browser developer tools to debug layout issues and optimize performance.
- Feedback from peers was incorporated to refine the design and functionality.

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them

### 1. **Responsive Design**

- **Challenge**: Ensuring the layout worked seamlessly across all screen sizes, especially for smaller devices.
- **Solution**: I used Bootstrap's grid system and media queries to create a responsive design.

### 2. **Navigation Overlap**

- **Challenge**: The navigation bar overlapped.
- **Solution**: I added padding, margin and other styles to the main content to prevent overlap.

### 3. **Accessibility**

- **Challenge**: Making the portfolio accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Solution**: I added ARIA roles, alt attributes for images, and skip links. I also ensured proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation.

### 4. **Animations**

- **Challenge**: Implementing smooth animations.
- **Solution**: I used CSS keyframes and transitions.
